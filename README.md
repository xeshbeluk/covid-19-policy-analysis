# COVID-19 Mortality Simulation Using MCMC and SIR Modeling

This repository contains an analytical framework for simulating and analyzing COVID-19 case and mortality data using a combination of regression modeling, time series diagnostics, and Bayesian inference with a custom SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model implemented in Stan. The analysis spans multiple countries and includes a specific focus on excess mortality in Russia.
